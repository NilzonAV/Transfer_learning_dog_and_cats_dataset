# Transfer Learning for Dog and Cat Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify images of dogs and cats by leveraging a pretrained image classifier through the principle of transfer learning. The project utilizes the dataset from the [Dogs vs. Cats Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes a pre-trained model to improve classification accuracy without the need for a large training dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Visualization**: Includes plotting utilities to visualize training results and model performance.

## Installation
